Questions:
-What are the results from the four executions of “atime”? 
-What are the differences? 

Each execution of atime shows a different time for either the access, the modification, or the changes in the file:

echo “write a text here” > text.txt    |  this one creates the file 
Copy text.txt text2.txt                |  this one changes the last access date because it reads the file
Chmod 600 text.txt                     |  this one changes the last change date because it changes permissions
echo “write a new text here” > text.txt|  this one changes the last modified date because it writes to the file


EXECUTION EXAMPLES (for reference):

$ echo "aa" > text.txt

$ date -r text.txt
lun oct 19 09:57:09 CEST 2020

$ ./time.out text.txt
text.txt --> last access: Mon Oct 19 09:57:09 2020
text.txt --> last modified: Mon Oct 19 09:57:09 2020
text.txt --> last change: Mon Oct 19 09:57:09 2020
